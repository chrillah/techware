# Techware - The future of tech and fashion

# Brief Project Description 
The website is created in HTML & CSS with a small JavaScript function. It is a final project for the HTML & CSS course in frontend development at ITHS.

# Description 
The purpose of the website is to showcase skills in HTML and CSS and responsive design. Proficiency is demonstrated by using appropriate HTML tags and styling with CSS. The design is created by myself. The idea behind the website is a satirical vision of the future where fashion, technology, and propaganda are intertwined and control humans and others around them. I have created the illustrations, and I am using an image from Unsplash.
